## About The Project

My portfolio combined with my darts game app and cloud service.

- **Portfolio**: Showcases my software development experience, projects, and hobbies.
- **Darts Game**: A fun way to play darts with my family and friends.
- **Cloud Service**: A private cloud storage solution, that allows me to access files anywhere.

I created an Android app for darts and cloud services using React Native: [HomeApp](https://github.com/jakuboldziej/HomeApp.git).
